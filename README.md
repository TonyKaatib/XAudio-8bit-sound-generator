# A 8-bit sound generator using XAudio, built in VCS

Basically what it says. It is minimally built so if you want to use this yourself, just put it on the IDE and decomment the line to extract the audio you generate by manually inputing it.

Yah, not the best user-friendly thing ever, but it does the job right.
